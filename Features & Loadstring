[★]  Script

print("Any issues with the script? Join the discord and report the issue to @streekaiz#1132")
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Streekaiz/kpubsrc/main/Source%20Code', true))()

[★]  Additional Notes

Only supported on KRNL & Synapse (No idea if this works for scriptware.)

| Just a small project. I may discontinue it whenever I want.
| 
| Hub will not get many updates either, but if I did it would be likely:
| 
| • Small changes, like changing a slider to a textbox.
| • Updating a game's script.
| • Swapping out dead games for more popular games.
| • UI
