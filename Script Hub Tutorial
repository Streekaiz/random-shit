Tutorial | Orion UI Lib

probably one of the easiest UI libs to work with, and it looks really clean too. And no, you don't need any lua knowledge to make a script hub. (Will be easy to understand)

[•] Info (skip this if you aren't planning to share your script hub.

First, make a discord server. This is where your users can suggest shit, and be informed on script hub updates. Make a [PERMANENT] link. (Sometimes discord is a absolute shit and resets it for no reason.) Now to copy a discord link, it is setclipboard("")
More on this in the others section.

[•] Window

This is what your UI library will look like.

local OrionLib = loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shlexware/Orion/main/source')))() -- ignore this.

local Window = OrionLib:MakeWindow({Name = "Title of the library", HidePremium = false, SaveConfig = true, ConfigFolder = "OrionTest", Intro enabled = <status>, IntroText = ""})

Let's start off with configuring the window. This is what your UI will look like.

For "Title of the library", replace it with what you're going to name your script hub.

Hidepremium. | I'd set it to true if your script hub is free and doesn't have a premium option.

Saveconfig | it's a script hub, don't see why u need a cfg lol. Just set to false

ConfigFolder | ignore

IntroEnabled | Decide if you want to enable a intro (set status to true if you want the intro, false if you don't want a intro.)

IntroText | Put between the " what you want your intro to say.

[•] Tabs & Buttons

Now, let's make a tab and add buttons to execute scripts.

Paste this (make window and this seperate/ put space between)

local Tab = Window:MakeTab({
	Name = "Tab 1",
	Icon = "rbxassetid://4483345998",
	PremiumOnly = false
})
Tab:AddButton({
	Name = "Button!",
	Callback = function()
      		print("button pressed")
  	end    
})

Replace Tab 1 with what you want the tab to be named as. Ignore everything else.

Now, the buttons. Replace Button! with whatever you'd like the button to be named.

Now, to execute a script by clicking it, paste a script between print("button pressed") and end. Let's use infinite yield as a example.
-- This is what it should look like.
Tab:AddButton({
	Name = "Infinite Yield",
	Callback = function()
      		print("button pressed")
loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source'), true))()
  	end    
})

A reminder that it needs to have a ", true" (just look at the inf yield script.)

Before executing, paste this at the END of the script hub

OrionLib:Init() -- required

Now execute your script. Congrats, you made your own script hub! You can keep adding buttons with different scripts.

[•] Others (MUST READ.)

Discord | If your script hub is public, make a discord and perm link. Now, make a button. Instead of a loadstring, do setclipboard("Link") (or without the ", Idk), setclipboard will copy whatever's between the ",

OrionLib:Init() is basically what allows your buttons n stuff to work (required at end)

Notifications | notify u 

OrionLib:MakeNotification({
	Name = "Title",
	Content = "Content",
	Image = "rbxassetid://4483345998",
	Time = 5
})

This is also quite helpful, it has many uses, like notifying the user to join your discord or whatever. You can also add a feature where pressing a button will spawn a notification. Just do the same thing with the loadstring.

 -- This is what it should look like.
Tab:AddButton({
	Name = "Infinite Yield",
	Callback = function()
      		print("button pressed")
OrionLib:MakeNotification({
	Name = "Title",
	Content = "Content",
	Image = "rbxassetid://4483345998",
	Time = 5
})
loadstring(game:HttpGet(('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield/master/source'), true))()
  	end    
})

Organizing |
Organizing is pretty important if you want to update your script easier and faster. ( -- info )

More tabs (& buttons ig)
For you to add buttons to multiple tabs, you need to put it below the tab script. Here's an example

Tab 1 (one you want the button to be in)
Tab 2
Button 

The button will be in Tab 2
But if you do
Tab 1
Button
Tab 2

The button will appear in tab 1, very simple.

Github
Probably the best website if you wanna host your script on it. To host your script with github, watch this video  (sign up for a acc on GitHub first.) https://youtu.be/MNISwiVX0UQ

You can come back to the repo (the script) and edit it. Now this gives you 2 extra benefits. Loadstring & Update Bot
For loadstring, "loadstring(Game:HttpGet("rawlink", true))()
For the raw link, simply click raw (at ur code page) and copy the link & paste it in there.

Now, update bot. 
Skip this if you aren't planning to make your script hub public. ( You need a phone.)
