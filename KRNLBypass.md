# Simple method to bypass the krnl key system (not doing the adverts)
## How to use it
Open up bypass.vip
You've probably tried this before, but this is because KRNL will change the key link when you press "Free Access With Ads"
Basically explaining, they use a fake link and then put the real link after pressing free access w/ ads

Now, go to your key system and go to one of the linkvertise checkpoints
Press free access w/ ads and then copy the linkvertise link
Put it into bypass.vip and wait a few 10-15 seconds
Then paste it onto **THE LINKVERTISE TAB**

Mow you basically kind of bypassed the krnl key system. enjoy!
