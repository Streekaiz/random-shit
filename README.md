# kpubsrc

A great script hub, with 20+ scripts.

EDIT:

The script hub won't be updated often anymore, since I have school and other IRL stuff.
If I end up not updating it (in 2-3 months), I will make it open source.
We are still a script library though, so you should join. I just do not have time to add a button n stuff and obfuscate again.
